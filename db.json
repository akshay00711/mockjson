      "Sora is an AI model that can create realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions.
      Today, Sora is becoming available to red teamers to assess critical areas for harms or risks
      We are also granting access to a number of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to gain feedback on how to advance the model to be most helpful for creative professionals.
      We’re sharing our research progress early to start working with and getting feedback from people outside of OpenAI and to give the public a sense of what AI capabilities are on the horizon.
      We’ll be taking several important safety steps ahead of making Sora available in OpenAI’s products."

      Based on a large language model, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.
      ChatGPT is available for use online in two versions, one built on GPT-3.5 and the other on GPT-4, both of which are members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google[8]—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning.",
